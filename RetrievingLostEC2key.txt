Answer:
   
       Launch 2 instances with their respective key pairs

          detach first instance volume from ec2 instance
          Attach this volume to new instance id
	  try accessing this attached volume from new instance ip through putty
	  Now stop the new instance and detach this volume from new instance
	  Attach this volume again to the first instance  
	  start the first instance again and try accessing it through putty
	 you can now access the first instance using second instance's key
